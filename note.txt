--legal first name , 
--legal last name , 
--a valid email address ( which a verifying link will be sent once done with the registration - so to complete the registration and      varify the chef to be valid ),
--a mobile phone number ( which a verifying OTP will be sent to the phone number once the chef clicks on verify phone number button on the dashboard .)
